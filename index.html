            <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
                building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
                community of individual developers and companies.</p>

            <p>A React component is a bit of code that represents a piece of the page. Each component is a JavaScript
                function that returns a piece of code that represents a piece of a web page.<br /><p>To use React, you need
                to create components that use JSX. Below is an example :</p>
                <br><code>function Heading(props) { return <span><</span><span>h1</span><span>></span>{props.value}<span><</span>/h1>; }</code>

                The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app and as
                an escape hatch to get outside of the React model if you need to. Most of your components should not
                need to use this module.

                        If the React element was previously rendered into container, this will perform an update on it
                        and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest React element.<br />

            <p>JSX is an embeddable XML-like syntax. It is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript, though the
                semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific. JSX rose to popularity with the React
                framework, but has since seen other implementations as well. TypeScript supports embedding, type
                checking, and compiling JSX directly to JavaScript.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="State">
            <header><b>State</b> </header>
            <p>The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A
                components state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders. The change in
                state can happen as a response to user action or system-generated events and these changes determine the
                behavior of the component and how it will render. </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="rendering">A state can be modified based on user action or network changes</li>

        <section class="main-section"id="Event_handling">
            <header><b>Event handling </b></header>
            <p>Event handlers determine what action is to be taken whenever an event is fired. This could be a button
                click or a change in a text input.
                <br>
                Essentially, event handlers are what make it possible for users to interact with your React app.
                Handling events with React elements is similar to handling events on DOM elements, with a few minor
                exceptions.<br> <br>
            </p>
            <p class="onClick "><span class="title">onClick handler in React<br><br></span>The React onClick event
                handler enables you to call a function and trigger an action when a user clicks an element, such as a
                button, in your app.

                Event names are written in camelCase, so the onclick event is written as onClick in a React app. In
                addition, React event handlers appear inside curly braces.

                Take the following simple example written in HTML:<br> <br><code><<span>b</span>utton onclick="sayHello()">
                        Say Hello<<span>b</span>utton></code><br>In a React app, this button onClick event would be
                written as follows:<br><br> <code><span><</span>button onClick={sayHello}>
                            Say Hello<span><</span>
                          button></code></p>

        <section class="main-section"id="Props">
            <header><b>Props</b></header>
            <p> the props are a type of object where the value of attributes of a tag is stored. The word
                “props” implies “properties”, and its working functionality is quite similar to HTML attributes.
                <br>
                Basically, these props components are read-only components. In ReactJS, the data can be passed from one
                component to another component using these props, similar to how the arguments are passed in a function.
                Inside the component, we can add the attributes called props; however, we cannot change or modify props
                inside the component as they are immutable.<br> Using the “this.props”, we can make the props available
                inside the components. Then, the dynamic data can be rendered through the render method. We need to add
                the props to the reactDOM.render() in the Main.js file of our ReactJS project of ReactJS if we need
                immutable data in the component. Then we can use it in the component where we want to use those dynamic
                data.
            </p>
            <p>Now let us go through an example with code implementation.<br> The code below is the Main.js file. Here,
                we pass the dynamic data for name attribute within the App component through the render method called
                reactDOM.render. <br><br>
                <code>import React from 'react'; <br> 

                    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';  <br>
                    
                    import App from './App.js'; <br> 
                    
                    ReactDOM.render(<span><</span>App name = "World of Programming!" />, document.getElementById('app'));  </code><br>The
                below code is for App.js. Here, we are using the dynamic data for the name attribute which the Main.js
                file has passed as props, and making the props available within this App component using
                “this.props”.<br><br><code>import React, { Component } from 'react';  <br>

                    class App extends React.Component {  <br>
                    
                       render() {    <br>
